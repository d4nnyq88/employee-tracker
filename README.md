# employee-tracker

The Employee Tracker project is JavaScript, Node.js, and Express focused project requiring the use of the Mysql2, Inquirer, and Console.table packages. The app utilizes SQL queries to update employee data within a database. When the App starts, the user is prompted with a list of actions he or she can take to either view data or make changes to data in the employee database. Depending on what the user selects, different SQL queries are used to either SELECT, INSERT, or UPDATE data in the database. After a selection is executed, the user will be prompted with a message that the action has been completed. The application is initialized in node using the command "npm start".
